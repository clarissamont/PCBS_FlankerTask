# Flanker Task
#### *Effects of noise letters upon the identification of a target letter in a nonsearch task (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974)*

### Project Description: 

The main goal of the original study was to observe response inhibition - that is, our ability to suppress responses that are contextually inappropriate given the task at hand. We provoke this response by presenting target stimuli with noise that provides either relevant or irrelevant information (i.e. "flankers"). 

The task consists of three types of stimuli, differing in how the flankers relate to the target stimulus. 

The target stimuli are arbitrarily chosen letters, assigned to directional responses (e.g. H & K = right; S & C = left). They are presented in the midst of flanker letters which surround them. Participants are instructed to press a button (right or left) depending on the directional association of the target stimulus (which is always in the middle of the letters presented in the stimulus. 

In **congruent stimuli** the target letter and the flankers correspond to the same directional response (e.g. HHHKHHH), in **incongruent stimuli**, the target letter and the flankers correspond to opposing directional responses (e.g. HHHSHHH), and in **neutral stimuli**, the flankers are letters which have not been assigned a directional response (e.g. AAASAAA). 

In the original study, participant responses were slower and less accurate in the incongruent condition, indicating difficulties inibiting responses that have been influenced by irrelevant noise.
